### Academic Stress Analysis

#### Project Overview

This project performs an analysis of academic stress levels, focusing on the relationship between academic competition and the stress experienced by students. The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter Notebook and leverages data visualization to present key findings.

#### Key Findings

  - **Competition and Stress:** A strong correlation was found between the level of academic competition and the stress index. As academic competition increases, so does the average stress level.
  - **Demographics:** The study is based on a dataset of 140 entries, with most respondents being undergraduate students.
  - **Contributing Factors:** Other factors analyzed include peer pressure and home pressure, with average ratings of 3.05 and 3.16 out of 5, respectively. The average overall stress index across the dataset is 3.71 out of 5.
  - **Coping Mechanisms:** The most common coping strategy among students is to "Analyze the situation and handle it with intelligence."

#### Technologies Used

  - Python
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - Jupyter Notebook

#### Getting Started

To replicate this analysis, you will need to set up a Python environment and install the required libraries.

**Prerequisites:**

  - Python 3.x
  - Jupyter Notebook

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

**Usage:**

1.  Clone this repository or download the project files.
2.  Ensure you have the dataset file `academic Stress level - maintainance 1.csv` in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
3.  Open the `AcedmicStressAnalysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
4.  Run all the cells in the notebook to view the analysis, visualizations, and conclusions.

#### Dataset

The analysis uses a dataset named `academic Stress level - maintainance 1.csv`. This dataset is essential for the notebook to run successfully.
